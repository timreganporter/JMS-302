JMS 302: Hacking the Media
==========================

This repository is for the class JMS 302: Hacking the Media offered by the Center for Collaborative Journalism at Mercer University.

Course Description
------------------
The course prepares you to be “hackers” in the sense of one who explores and delights in the workings of computers and stretches the capabilities of available software and hardware. You will learn how to program for the web (including the mobile web). To accomplish that end, you will use HTML5 and CSS to makes pages look like you want. You will use JavaScript for basic interactivity in the browser. And you will learn Ruby, a powerful interpreted programming language, to do more heavy-duty work and—more importantly—to learn some fundamentals of programming. The goal of this course is not to provide all the skills necessary to become a working programmer, but to provide enough knowledge to understand existing web and mobile implementations and modify them to meet specific needs, and to provide a foundation for you to have meaningful dialogue with technologists in media (or other) organizations.
